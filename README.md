# Full-Suite-of-Business-Intelligence-and-Business-Analytics
This is a group project I did for my postgraduate degree. The project enhances a company's business operation and customer experience by leveraging data-driven insights and efficient business processes.

# WORKFLOW
Porter's five forces was used to understand the Competitive forces in the industry, determine the power of suppliers and customers, and the threat of substitute products.
Fit Gap Analysis was used to identify the current state of the business and the desired future state.
Mockaroo was used to generate data relating to the business operation.
Salesforce CRM was used for Account Implementation, Contact Implementation, Opportunities Implementation, Publisher opportunity, Market Campaign Implementation,and Social Media Campaign Implementation.
Tableau was used to generate 4 dashboards for the business namely: Operational Dashboard, Inventory Dashboard, Tactical Dashboard, and Marketing Dashboard.
Operational dashboard gave an overview of the current state of the business on a daily basis.
Inventory Dashboard gave a comprehensive inventory management overview, such as remaining stock quantities for specific genres, inquiries regarding genre availability, and actual sales figures for each category.
Tactical Dashboard gave an overview of top-performing business areas, enabling us to plan and organize accordingly based on the insights they provide.
Marketing Dashboard gave a real-time update on the status and progress of various marketing campaigns. It offers valuable insights into their performance and effectiveness, guiding the business in making informed decisions.
